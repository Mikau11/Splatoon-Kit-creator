Hello again! this is a work in progress, so far only creating weapons/kits in splatoon 3 is possible as this is a VERY monotonous task, but shouldn't be too difficualt as its already like a 1/5 of the way done 


(4/2/26) Hey, just an update, while you can still only create splatoon 3 kits/weapons, I have updated the way they are made(though you may not see it, as its more of a convience thing on my end), and you can now save your weapons!
